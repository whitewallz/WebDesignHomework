1. Explain how web browsers function
  <p>Web Browsers are made up of 7 componenents that interpret the code into a viewable usable website. The UI (User Interface), rendering engine, browser engine, network, javascript, 
javascript interpreter and Data Storage. The UI is the part that the user sees at the top of the screen in most cases and uses to navigate the page. The rendering engine uses all 
of the data and code to create the webpage that we see. The browser engine tells the parts of the page where to be and makes things happen. the Network is the connection to the internet, 
where the images, audio and other files are fetched. The javascript is the programming language that all of the code is written in, which is then translated into the DOM by the interpreter.
Data Storage is things like cookies that sotre information.</p>

2. Define and describe DOM
 <p>DOM is Document Object Module. It is kind of like a tree containing the branches and nodes with information that the rendering engine can use to create the website we see. it's a kind of
middle step.</p> 

3. What is the difference between HTML XML and XHTML? 
 <p> HTML is the most widely used web language and is the foundation and structure of the pages contents. while HTML displays document nodes, XML describes them and provides information without
really doing anything. XHTML is a sort of combination of the two and is much more precise.</p>
